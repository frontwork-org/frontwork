# Frontwork - EXPERIMENTAL TypeScript Framework using Deno & Webassembly

- Create Server-Side Rendering and Client-Side Rendering with the same Typescript code
- Routing System with Domains included
- Deno as server side renderer and assets sender
    - Simple assets sender with the method setup_assets_resolver(assets_dir)
- CLI Tool to create project like ng, and provide CI capabilities like npm
- Dynamic Imports with esbuild Code Splitting

## Getting Started
For getting started you need to install the frontwork-cli tool "frontwork": 

    cargo install frontwork  
Or install it [manually](https://github.com/frontwork-org/frontwork/releases/latest/download/frontwork)  
  
And then use `frontwork install` to install required dev-dependencies 

To start a new project you can use `frontwork init` to use the current directory or `frontwork new` to create a new one.

### help wanted

#### Missing support for the desktop platform

#### Missing support for android

#### Missing iOS and Mac support
To develeop any app for an apple product, MacOS is required to develop and digitaly sign the app. But because I do not own any products of apple, it is not possible for me to develeop for it.   
Still, apple has a market share, thus Frontwork will support apple products in the future.  
If you are interested to support them, then please create a pull request.
